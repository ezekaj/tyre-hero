# TyreHero PWA - Emergency Mobile-First Deployment Guide

## 🚨 Complete Progressive Web App Implementation

TyreHero has been transformed into a production-ready Progressive Web App optimized specifically for emergency mobile tyre service scenarios. This implementation focuses on critical emergency needs where network connectivity may be poor and users are under stress.

## 📱 PWA Features Implemented

### 1. Service Worker (`sw.js`)
**Emergency-focused caching strategy:**
- **Emergency Cache**: Critical assets cached with highest priority
- **Network-first for emergency requests**: 3-second timeout with fallback
- **Background sync**: Failed requests queued for retry when online
- **Cache strategy**: Critical emergency assets, static assets, dynamic content
- **Offline fallback**: Custom offline page with emergency contacts

### 2. Web App Manifest (`manifest.json`)
**Installation and app behavior:**
- Standalone display mode for app-like experience
- Emergency-themed branding with red color scheme
- Quick actions: Emergency service, Call now, Book service, Track service
- Proper icon sizes (72px to 512px) including maskable icons
- Edge panel support and launch handler configuration

### 3. Emergency Touch Optimizations (`mobile-emergency.css`)
**One-handed operation focus:**
- **Touch targets**: Minimum 44px, emergency buttons 56-72px
- **Thumb zone optimization**: Critical actions in reachable areas
- **Haptic feedback**: Touch response for emergency actions
- **High contrast mode**: Better visibility in emergency situations
- **Dark mode**: Battery saving for OLED screens
- **Pull-to-refresh**: Emergency data updates

### 4. Push Notifications (`push-notifications.js`)
**Real-time emergency updates:**
- Service status notifications
- Technician dispatch alerts
- Arrival time updates
- Emergency location sharing
- Background sync for failed requests
- Notification actions (track, call, view details)

### 5. Offline Functionality (`offline-features.js`)
**Critical emergency features work offline:**
- Emergency form submission (syncs when online)
- Cached emergency contacts
- Location data caching
- Service information offline access
- IndexedDB storage for persistent data
- Automatic background sync

### 6. Battery Optimization (`emergency-battery-optimization.js`)
**Extended device life in emergencies:**
- **Critical battery mode** (<10%): Emergency-only interface
- **Low battery mode** (<20%): Reduced animations and features
- **Dark mode activation**: Automatic OLED power saving
- **Performance optimization**: Disabled non-critical processes
- **Emergency mode UI**: Simplified interface for critical battery
- **Location sharing**: Quick emergency location broadcast
