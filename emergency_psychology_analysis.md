# Emergency Psychology and User Behavior During Tyre Emergencies

## Introduction

Understanding the psychological aspects of tyre emergencies is crucial for designing an effective mobile tyre service website. This document explores how users think, feel, and behave during tyre-related emergencies, and how these insights can be applied to create a website that addresses their needs during these stressful situations.

## Psychological Impact of Tyre Emergencies

### Emotional Responses

1. **Immediate Stress Reactions**
   - Frustration and anger at the unexpected disruption
   - Anxiety about safety and being stranded
   - Fear, especially if the breakdown occurs in an unfamiliar or unsafe location
   - Helplessness and vulnerability due to lack of control over the situation
   - Panic, which can impair decision-making abilities

2. **Long-term Psychological Effects**
   - Research shows that traumatic breakdown experiences can lead to anxiety and depression
   - Frequent breakdowns may cause ongoing stress and anticipatory anxiety
   - Some drivers develop avoidance behaviors (avoiding certain routes or driving altogether)

### Cognitive Impact

1. **Decision-Making Under Stress**
   - Reduced ability to process information effectively
   - Tendency to make impulsive decisions rather than rational ones
   - Narrowed focus (tunnel vision) that may miss important details
   - Difficulty weighing options and considering consequences

2. **Cognitive Distortions**
   - Catastrophizing (assuming the worst possible outcome)
   - Blaming (self or others) for the situation
   - All-or-nothing thinking ("My whole day/trip is ruined")
   - Overgeneralizing ("This always happens to me")

## User Behavior During Tyre Emergencies

### Action Patterns

1. **Initial Response**
   - Most drivers instinctively brake quickly when experiencing a tyre blowout (though experts advise against this)
   - Many immediately reach for their phone to call for help

   - Others may panic and make potentially dangerous decisions (stopping in unsafe locations)

2. **Information-Seeking Behavior**
   - Urgent searches for immediate solutions
   - Focus on quick fixes rather than comprehensive information
   - Preference for clear, concise instructions over detailed explanations
   - Multiple rapid searches across different platforms
