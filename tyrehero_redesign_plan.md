# TyreHero Website Redesign Plan

## Design Inspiration & Direction

Based on our research of modern UI/UX trends, award-winning automotive websites, and high-conversion emergency service designs, we've identified the following key elements to incorporate into the TyreHero redesign:

### Brand Identity & Visual Language

- **Bold, Hero-Focused Design**: Drawing inspiration from Rivian and Tesla's clean, product-focused approach with large hero sections that immediately communicate the emergency service value proposition.
- **Color Scheme**: A high-contrast palette with:
  - Primary: Deep red (#E53935) - Represents urgency and emergency services
  - Secondary: Bright yellow (#FFCC00) - Represents caution and visibility (like hazard lights)
  - Accent: Deep blue (#1A2A56) - Represents trust and reliability
  - Neutral: Dark gray (#212121) and white (#FFFFFF) for text and backgrounds
- **Typography**: 
  - Headings: Montserrat Bold - Strong, modern, and highly legible
  - Body: Poppins - Clean, contemporary, and excellent readability on all devices
- **Visual Elements**:
  - Custom hero illustrations showing the emergency tyre service in action
  - Animated icons representing speed, reliability, and 24/7 service
  - Real photography of service vehicles and technicians (no stock photos)

### User Experience & Interaction Design

- **Streamlined Emergency Flow**: Inspired by healthcare urgent care websites, create a prominent "Emergency Tyre Service" path that requires minimal clicks (3 or fewer) to request service.
- **Real-Time Information**: Display current response times and availability by location, similar to healthcare wait time indicators.
- **Micro-interactions**: Implement subtle animations for buttons, form fields, and navigation elements to enhance engagement.
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Design for mobile users first, with large tap targets, simplified navigation, and quick-access emergency buttons.
- **Dark Mode Support**: Implement automatic dark mode detection for better visibility at night (when many tyre emergencies occur).

### Key Features & Components

1. **Emergency Hero Section**:
   - Full-width design with bold typography and clear CTA
   - Animated elements showing response time countdown
   - One-tap emergency service request button
   - Location detection for faster service

2. **Service Selector**:
   - Interactive tool to help users determine if they need emergency or scheduled service
   - Visual decision tree with simple icons and minimal text
   - Immediate routing to appropriate booking flow

3. **Location-Based Experience**:
   - Map integration showing service coverage areas
   - Real-time technician availability by location
   - Estimated arrival times based on current conditions

4. **Trust Builders**:
   - Customer testimonial carousel with real emergency service stories
   - Service guarantees with bold visuals
   - Technician profiles with credentials and experience
   - Brand partnerships (tyre manufacturers, roadside assistance programs)

5. **Streamlined Booking Process**:
   - Reduce steps from 16+ to 8 or fewer
   - Smart forms that adapt based on service type
   - Save user information for repeat customers
   - Multiple payment options with clear pricing

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Framework & Technologies

- **Framework**: React with Next.js for server-side rendering and optimal performance
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid development and consistent design system
- **Animations**: GSAP for smooth, performance-optimized animations
- **State Management**: React Context API for simpler state needs
- **Maps & Location**: Google Maps API with custom styling

### Performance Optimization

- Implement lazy loading for images and non-critical content
- Use next-generation image formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Implement service worker for offline capabilities
- Use code splitting to reduce initial load time

### Accessibility Considerations

- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Implement proper heading hierarchy and landmark regions
- Provide alternative text for all images
- Ensure sufficient color contrast (minimum 4.5:1)
- Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Structure & Emergency Flow
- Create responsive layout framework
- Implement emergency service request flow
- Design and build hero section with primary CTAs
- Develop location detection and service area mapping

### Phase 2: Content & Service Pages
- Design and implement service description pages
- Create interactive pricing calculator
- Develop technician profiles and trust elements
- Build FAQ and help resources

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Optimization
- Implement real-time availability system
