This document explores how users think, feel, and behave during tyre-related emergencies, and how these insights can be applied to create a website that addresses their needs during these stressful situations.\n\n## Psychological Impact of Tyre Emergencies\n\n### Emotional Responses\n\n1. **Immediate Stress Reactions**\n   - Frustration and anger at the unexpected disruption\n   - Anxiety about safety and being stranded\n   - Fear, especially if the breakdown occurs in an unfamiliar or unsafe location\n   - Helplessness and vulnerability due to lack of control over the situation\n   - Panic, which can impair decision-making abilities\n\n2. **Long-term Psychological Effects**\n   - Research shows that traumatic breakdown experiences can lead to anxiety and depression\n   - Frequent breakdowns may cause ongoing stress and anticipatory anxiety\n   -
