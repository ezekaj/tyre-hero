[It\\\\u2019s essential to have emergency tire services at your disposal to reduce downtime](https://www.bauerbuilt.com/bauer-built-blog/why-commercial-fleets-need-a-roadside-assistance-plan/)\\\\u00a0and keep your fleet rolling. These services address a variety of repairs, from tire replacement to wheel repair.\\\\n\\\\n## Emergency Tire Replacement\\\\n\\\\nSelecting your tires based on application, size, load capacity, vehicle and terrain allows you to optimize their performance. However, accidents happen, so it\\\\u2019s important to have an emergency tire replacement service on standby.\\\\n\\\\nOnce you contact an emergency tire service provider, a technician will meet you at your location and complete an assessment of the damage. The results will determine whether they\\\\u2019ll need to apply a patch, replace your tire with a spare or tow you to a service station for further assistance.\\\\n\\\\n## Roadside Wheel and Rim Repair\\\\n\\\\nHitting potholes and curbs, overloading and failing to maintain proper tire inflation can lead to cracked or bent wheels and rims. You may also sustain wheel damage following a collision. It\\\\u2019s crucial to address signs of wheel and rim issues immediately to prevent unsafe handling.\\\\n\\\\nEmergency roadside service providers assess potential damage on the spot to determine a temporary fix and arrange towing if necessary. Our service vehicles carry spare wheels in case yours is bent or broken.\\\\n\\\\nAfter completing their repairs, they will remount your commercial tires, ensure they\\\\u2019re properly inflated, and conduct a safety test.\\\\n\\\\n## Tire Pressure Adjustment and Inflation\\\\n\\\\nImproper tire inflation is one of the leading [causes of blowouts](https://www.bauerbuilt.com/bauer-built-blog/commercial-tire-blowouts-causes-and-prevention/). Maintaining tire inflation improves handling, safety, fuel efficiency and tire longevity.\\\\n\\\\nDuring an onsite evaluation, a technician will use a digital or analog gauge to check your vehicle\\\\u2019s tire pressure and ensure it meets manufacturer recommendations. Our emergency service vehicles have industrial air compressors to inflate tires on the spot.\\\\n\\\\nIf you have a persistent leak, a service technician will check for punctures and faulty valves. The issue may require a seal, patch or further repair if the damage is too extensive. Your tire may need to be adjusted after the service is complete.\\\\n\\\\n## Emergency Towing for Tire-Related Breakdowns\\\\n\\\\nThe extent of the damage and preexisting issues will determine if you can receive roadside repairs. Emergency service providers can arrange towing services to ensure safe removal and continued repairs at their nearest location. Your tire will undergo a comprehensive repair, or you may need to purchase a replacement if the issue is irreparable.\\\\n\\\\nHaving access to those services reduces the amount of time you spend on the side of the road, helping you maintain efficiency and prevent loss of revenue.\\\\n\\\\n## Tire Failure Prevention Tips\\\\n\\\\n* [Conduct regular pre- and post-trip tire inspections](https://www.bauerbuilt.com/bauer-built-blog/how-regular-tire-inspections-extend-service-life/)\\\\u00a0to spot early signs of damage and wear.\\\\n* Practice good driving habits. Avoid excessive braking, speeding and making tight turns.\\\\n* Avoid road debris and potholes as much as possible.\\\\n* Check tire pressures daily.\\\\n* Install tire pressure monitoring systems (TPMS) to assess inflation in real-time.\\\\n* Rotate drive and steer tires every 50,000 miles to promote even tread wear.\\\\n* Have an emergency service plan prepared in the event of a flat tire or mechanical issue on the road.\\\\n\\\\n## Emergency Roadside Service from Bauer Built\\\\n\\\\nWhenever you need roadside service, Bauer Built is ready to help.
