   - Time pressure creates urgency and anxiety
   - Safety concerns, especially if stranded in unfamiliar or unsafe locations

2. **Vulnerability**
   - Feeling of helplessness, especially for users with limited mechanical knowledge
   - Concern about being overcharged or taken advantage of
   - Physical vulnerability when stranded on roadside

   - Uncertainty about resolution timeframe
   - Limited options in immediate vicinity
   - Potential communication difficulties in explaining location/situation

### Decision-Making Factors in Emergency Situations
