## Conclusion

Our research has shown that creating an effective mobile tyre website requires a careful balance between addressing emergency needs and providing comprehensive service information. By prioritizing user needs during stressful situations while also offering educational content for planned purchases, a mobile tyre service can build trust, increase conversions, and establish a strong market position.

The key to success lies in understanding the psychological state of users during tyre emergencies and designing an experience that reduces anxiety, builds trust, and provides clear, simple pathways to resolution. By implementing the recommendations outlined in this research, a mobile tyre service website can deliver an exceptional user experience that meets customer needs in both emergency and non-emergency situations.

The next steps in this project should focus on developing specific user personas, creating detailed user journeys, and beginning the design process with mobile-first wireframes that prioritize the emergency booking flow.
